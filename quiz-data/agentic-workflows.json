    {
      "questionNumber": 0,
      "questionText": "When should you use the Task tool to spawn a subagent instead of doing work directly?",
      "type": "multiple_choice",
      "required": true,
      "options": [
        "For any task that takes more than one tool call",
        "For complex multi-step tasks or open-ended exploration",
        "Always - subagents are more efficient",
        "Never - direct tool calls are always better"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "correctAnswer": "For complex multi-step tasks or open-ended exploration",
      "explanation": "Task tool is for complex tasks requiring multiple rounds of exploration. Simple tasks should use direct tool calls."
