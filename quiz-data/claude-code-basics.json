Using 'cat' via Bash bypasses these optimizations, requiring manual approval for each unique command. In vibe coding sessions where you're rapidly iterating, the Read tool keeps you in flow. This is a key differentiator from traditional scripting—Claude Code's specialized tools are designed for AI-assisted workflows, not human typing.",

Claude Code's Edit tool evolved specifically for AI-assisted coding where precision matters. It performs surgical replacements while preserving indentation, line endings, and surrounding code. This prevents accidental changes that can break working code—a critical concern when an AI is making changes at scale. The Edit tool also shows you exactly what changed, maintaining transparency in vibe coding sessions.",

By requiring Read-before-Edit, Claude Code ensures the AI has current context about the file's state. This evolved from early failures where AI assistants would propose changes based on outdated assumptions. The rule enforces 'see before you change,' which is even more critical than in human programming since AI can't rely on memory of files it read in previous sessions.",

Unlike 'find' which can hang on large directories or node_modules, Glob is optimized for speed and respects .gitignore patterns. In vibe coding, you need instant file discovery—waiting for a slow 'find' command breaks the creative flow. Glob also integrates with Claude Code's context management, so results can be efficiently passed to other operations without permission overhead.",

In shell scripting, everything goes through bash. In Claude Code, file operations have dedicated tools optimized for AI workflows.
