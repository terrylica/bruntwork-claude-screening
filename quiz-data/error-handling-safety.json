    {
      "questionNumber": 0,
      "questionText": "When a Bash command exits with a non-zero exit code, what should you do?",
      "type": "multiple_choice",
      "required": true,
      "options": [
        "Ignore it and continue with the next task",
        "Stop and acknowledge the failure, diagnose, then fix",
        "Retry the same command automatically",
        "Report to the user and wait for instructions"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "correctAnswer": "Stop and acknowledge the failure, diagnose, then fix",
      "explanation": "Never ignore non-zero exits. Acknowledge, diagnose from stderr, fix the root cause, then verify success."
    },
    {
      "questionNumber": 1,
      "questionText": "What is the correct pattern for handling cd failures in shell scripts?",
      "type": "multiple_choice",
      "required": true,
      "options": [
        "cd /path/to/dir",
        "cd /path/to/dir || exit 1",
        "cd /path/to/dir 2>/dev/null",
        "if cd /path/to/dir; then echo 'ok'; fi"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "correctAnswer": "cd /path/to/dir || exit 1",
      "explanation": "cd can fail silently. Always handle with || exit 1 or || { echo 'Failed'; exit 1; }"
    },

      "questionNumber": 2,
      "questionText": "When writing Python code, which exception handling pattern is WRONG?",

      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "correctAnswer": "except Exception: pass",
      "explanation": "Bare 'except: pass' swallows all errors silently, hiding bugs. Always catch specific exceptions and handle/log them."

      "questionText": "What is the risk of using subprocess.run() without check=True in Python?",
      "type": "multiple_choice",
      "required": true,
      "options": [
        "No risk - it's the recommended pattern",
        "The command output is not captured",

      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "correctAnswer": "Non-zero exit codes are silently ignored",
      "explanation": "Without check=True, subprocess.run() returns normally even on failure. Always use check=True."

        "Files outside the working directory are completely inaccessible",

      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "correctAnswer": "You can access the filesystem but with user-level permissions",
      "explanation": "Claude Code has filesystem access with user permissions. You can read/write files the user can access."

      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "correctAnswer": "Only when the user explicitly asks",

      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "correctAnswer": "Point it out and offer to fix it",
      "explanation": "Always flag security issues. Be helpful by offering to fix, but don't modify without acknowledgment."

      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "correctAnswer": "Explain the scope and get confirmation from the user",
      "explanation": "For bulk operations, explain what will be affected and confirm before proceeding. Users need to understand scope."
