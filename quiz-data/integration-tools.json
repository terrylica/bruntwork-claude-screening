      "explanation": "WHY THIS MATTERS: MCP extends Claude Code beyond its built-in tools. Database connectors, API integrations, custom search engines - MCP servers provide these capabilities through a standardized protocol. This is how you make Claude Code domain-specific: connect it to your internal tools, your company's APIs, your specialized data sources. It transforms Claude from a general assistant into a specialized team member.",

      "correctAnswer": "A feature that reduces token usage by lazy-loading tool descriptions only when needed",
      "explanation": "WHY THIS MATTERS: Every tool description consumes context tokens. With many MCP servers, you could spend 40%+ of your context just describing available tools. Tool Search solves this by loading tool descriptions on-demand - Claude sees a tool index initially, then fetches full descriptions only for tools it might use. This optimization enables large tool libraries without context bloat.",
