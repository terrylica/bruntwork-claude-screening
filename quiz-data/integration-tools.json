Database connectors, API integrations, custom search engines - MCP servers provide these capabilities through a standardized protocol. This is how you make Claude Code domain-specific: connect it to your internal tools, your company's APIs, your specialized data sources. It transforms Claude from a general assistant into a specialized team member.",

Tool Search solves this by loading tool descriptions on-demand - Claude sees a tool index initially, then fetches full descriptions only for tools it might use. This optimization enables large tool libraries without context bloat.",
