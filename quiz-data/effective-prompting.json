It automatically detects your tech stack, project structure, build commands, and common patterns, creating a CLAUDE.md foundation you can customize. This is universally recommended as the first step in any new project - it gives Claude immediate understanding of your codebase without manual documentation.",

Without clear success criteria, it might produce something that looks right but doesn't work. Tests, linters, type checkers, and screenshots create objective feedback loops - the write-test cycle (write code, run it, check output, repeat) is what enables reliable autonomous operation.
